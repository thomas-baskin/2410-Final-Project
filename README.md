# FCC Lyrics Checker
## Background
I run a radio show and I spend a lot of time looking up the lyrics for songs that I want to play on air. I run a daytime show which means I cannot curse or neither can my songs. This program was a proof of concept for making a program which takes Spotify playlists and checks their lyrics for curse words.
## Summary
This program allows Spotify users to drag and drop any number of playlists into a GUI that will check the lyrics of all of the songs in those playlists and determine whether they are FCC compliant.
## Users Be Warned!
If you are trying to use this program, *be warned* using my program is prohibited by AToZ lyrics. Again, this was a proof of concept, not intended for widespread use.

## Extensibility
I would use the likely use the Spotify API in the future if I were to build on this. Again, this was a proof of concept.
